# gitbook-plugin-summary
Gitbook plugin to auto-generate SUMMARY.md

## Introduction

This plugin was created out of the frustration of not having a way to auto-generate a SUMMARY.md file, out of a basic tree structure. The outcome is that you install this plugin and it just works, on top of your current `book.json` file. No custom configurations required.

## Installation

```shell
$ npm i gitbook-plugin-summary --save
```

## Usage

```shell
$ gitbook serve
```
